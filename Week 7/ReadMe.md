2) Must use embedded styles on a page affecting at least three tags.
3) Must use an external style sheet.
4) Must class selectors in your external style sheet that affect at least two tags in your page
5) Must have id selectors in your external style sheet that affect at least two tags in your page
6) One page must use either a CDN reference to Bootstrap (or another external CSS library) or a downloaded (local) version.
7) Add a background image using CSS to your second page
8) Upload your files to your GitHub repository (create a folder called Homework 7 or something like it) and turn in your link.
9) Post on discord for the discussion topic: about communication. We will discuss how often digital communication gets misconstrued and misinterpreted. The real question is how do we correct it when it happens and how to do we prevent it from happening in the first place
