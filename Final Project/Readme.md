Final Project - README.md

The purpose of this Readme.md is to describe and document the process of my project over its entire life cycle. It covers the final product, its iterations, successes, failures, lessons that I learned, and the sources and guides that helped me to complete the project.

# Life Cycle of the Project
1. The first major step I took after creating my project proposal was to set up my final project folder on GitHub. 
2. Once the folder was created, I set up my html file which proved to be hard than I thought. The main struggle was deciding between whether to referenece the p5.js files I needed either locally or using a CDN. After struggling with the local copies of p5.js on my computer, I ultimately decided that using a CDN would be the better option, as there is less file management involved.
3. Once the html was setup I created my js sketch file in which I would do the majority of my coding.
    - To start, I focused on the canvas, loading in one song, and making the song play and pause.
4. Next, I started working on my first visualization. I had to do lots of research, but ultimately learned that using a waveform and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) would be a great start to getting the visualization to sync with the audio.
5. Now that I had a basic waveform, I wanted to experiment with how to make it look a little more visually appealing, which included introducing color and mirroring the waveform to make it look more cohesive.
6. After creating the first waveform, I wanted to work on my second one. I learned how to turn that original waveform into a circle, using some math and a for loop to mirror the first half of the circle. I will touch more on this in the Successes and Failures Section.
7. Once I had the first two visualization, I started to work on two things. Uploading more than one song and creating drop down menus for both the
