# Project Proposal

Below are the required sections to include in the project proposal, please refer to each section for specific details on my project.

# A proposal for what you want to create for your final project.

For the MART120 final project, I plan to develop an innovative audio-visual music player, utilizing the p5.js library. The primary objective of this application is to provide users with an immersive experience that integrates sound with dynamic visualizations. My hope is to enhance the enjoyment of music through these interactive elements. 

The key features of the music player will include: 
* User-friendly controls to play and pause music 
* A slider to adjust the volume to the user's preference, ensuring an optimal listening experience. 
* Offering the ability for the user to switch between different visualizations, each uniquely responding to the music's sound. 

# Related and similar work that is serving as an inspiration.

The concept for this audio-visual music player draws inspiration from several notable projects I have found. One key influence is "The Waveform," which is an interactive music player that synchronizes visual wave patterns with different audio tracks. Additionally, the "p5 Music Visualizer" project is a good example of using p5.js to create dynamic graphics that respond to live music inputs, serving as a great place for me to start. These projects not only showcase the potential of integrating visual elements with sound but also emphasize the importance of user interaction in enhancing the multimedia experience. By studying these existing projects, I will have a good grasp on integrating sound into coding, which is something I have never done before on my own. Lastly, there is a plethora of visualization tutorials on YouTube that can help me when it comes time to design the different visualizations that I want the user of my program to choose from.

## Briefly discuss other artists or projects that are similar or influential to your proposed final project.

There are many artists/projects that have been influential to my project idea.Robert Hodgin's "Magnetosphere" is particularly inspirational, utilizing real-time audio to drive different visual effects. Another influential project is the "Monstercat Visualizer," which is a popular feature in music streaming that adapts its visuals based on the audio spectrum. This is sort of the main design most people think of when it comes to audio-visualization. The typical bar-chart design that reacts to the different musical components and volume.Another inspiration for me is Universal Everything, particularly their sound-reactive installations. These projects havr drawn my attention to this sort of project as the program will react with the sounds that I include in the program.

# A brief discussion of any problems you know you will have to solve or new technologies/techniques you will need to learn.

I anticipate several challenges while I create this project, particularly around the integrating sound using p5.js techniques and the real-time visualizations interacting with the music. One key technical area I'll need to overcome is achieving precise synchronization between the visual effects and the audio stream. This will require an understanding of p5.js's sound library, especially in analyzing and processing audio data in real time to help with the visual outputs.

Additionally, maintaining a smooth and responsive user interface while handling complex visual effects is essential. To enhance performance and prevent potential lag, I will need to figure out different p5.js optimization techniques. This project will not only push my technical skills but also expand my knowledge in programing with multimedia.

# A work plan, with internal deadlines for yourself and a description about how you intent to complete the final project on time. (Note: there will be no extensions offered for the final project).

To ensure the completion of my audio-visual music player by the May 5th deadline, I have my work plan created to help map out the project's milestones along the way.

 ## Week 1 (April 22 - 24): Project Setup and Initial Research

* Set up the basic project framework using p5.js.
* Conduct detailed research into p5.jsâ€™s sound library and explore examples of existing audio-visual projects for inspiration.
* Define the core functionalities: playback controls, volume adjustment, and visualization switching.

## Week 2 (April 25 - April 30): Development of Core Features

* Develop the play/pause functionality and integrate it with the user interface.
* Implement the volume control slider.
* Start experimenting with basic visualizations that respond to music.

## Week 3 (May 1 - May 5): Advanced Features and Final Touches

* Continue to refine and expand the visualizations, adding the ability to switch between different styles.
* Optimize the synchronization between the audio and visual elements to ensure smooth performance.
* Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality and usability.
* Polish the user interface, focusing on usability and design aesthetics.

# A discussion of any work you have completed this week towards your final project.

The work that I have completed this week includes: 
* Completing the project proposal
* Setting up the project's basic framework using p5.js
* Researching the integration of sound with p5.js
* Researching different visualizations to include
