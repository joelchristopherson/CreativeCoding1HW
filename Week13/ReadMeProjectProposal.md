# Project Proposal

For my Final Project, I am interested in continuing on website design for the site I have been building over the last few weeks. The site would include the pages I have already created with the addition of some of the following ideas:
1) Workout Timer
2) Interactive Workout Planner
3) Body Mass Index (BMI) and Calorie Calculator
4) Interactive Nutrition Guide
5) Interactive Quizzes for Personalized Workout Recommendations
6) Random Workout Generator
7) Personal Goal Trackers
8) Exercise Encyclopedia
9) Fitness Level Assessment Tool
10) Receipe Book
