# Homework
This week, you are going to animate your self-portrait. Now that you know how to make objects move back and forth, choose a few simple shapes to go back and forth along the x-axis. Also, select a couple of your shapes to move along the y-axis, and at least one simple shape to move using both the x and y-axis. Finally, make the title of your portrait get bigger five times and then smaller five times. Repeat that forever.

Here is an example that does some of the following items below: Homework Example

## Specifics:

1) Make at least two simple shapes in your self-portrait move back and forth along the x-axis.
2) Make at least two simple shapes in your self-portrait move back and forth along the y-axis.
3) Have the shapes move at different random speeds.
4) Make at least one shape move back and forth along the x and y-axis (diagonally).
5) Make the title of your self-portrait get larger five times and then get smaller five times. Repeat forever.
6) Upload your project to GitHub and turn your link into Moodle.
